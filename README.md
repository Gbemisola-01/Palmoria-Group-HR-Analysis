# Palmoria-Group-HR-Analysis

How I cleaned the dataset and work on identifying the gender inequality in the Palmoria Group HR Department.

## THE PROBLEM
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published in the news with the headline "Palmoria, the Manufacturing Partriarchy". This doesn't look good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even oversea. Cases like this can only spiral downwards revealingother issues like gender pay gap amongst other possible issues.

## TASK GIVEN
To identify key areas within the business that could spring up issues and address them immediately. As an HR Analytics expert, the company's was analyzed and recommendations for management's attention was given.
